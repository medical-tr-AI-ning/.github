**medical tr.AI.ning is a virtual reality training platform, designed for integration into the medical curriculum to enhance the clinical reasoning capabilities of future physicians.
The platform allows medical students to train clinical competencies from a first-person perspective with virtual, intelligent and interactive patients in an authentic simulated environment. Individual scenarios can be intuitively created by customizing specific parameters regarding patient, pathology and environment to support situated learning.**

# Platform Components

## [VR Runtime](https://github.com/medical-tr-AI-ning/vr-runtime)

This VR application features an **immersive patient interview and examination simulation** with a focus on dermatology.
Conduct a realistic patient interview and identify possible risk factors, then examine the patient's skin for dermatological abnormalities using a dermatoscope.

## [Authoring Tool](https://github.com/medical-tr-AI-ning/authoring-tool)

The Authoring Tool desktop application is used to **configure and export individually created medical scenarios** to use in the VR Runtime.
It features customization of the VR environment, the patient character and the anamnesis interaction.

# Additional Resources

## [Common Medical Assets](https://github.com/medical-tr-AI-ning/common-assets)

Medical assets created in the scope of this project have been published in a separate repository for use in future educational projects.
This includes **3D Models, Environments, Characters and other digital assets**.

## [Project Wiki](https://github.com/medical-tr-AI-ning/.github/wiki)

The project wiki contains tutorials how to use the application with different hardware setups, as well as how to effectively utilize the Authoring Tool to create and use custom scenarios.
